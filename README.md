 Fraud Detection in Financial Transactions

 Overview
This project focuses on building a robust machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in a large financial dataset. Leveraging advanced techniques, the model identifies suspicious activities with high accuracy, aiming to prevent financial losses and enhance security.

 Feature
LightGBM Classification Model Implemented a highly efficient LightGBM model for binary classification of transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.
Custom Feature Engineering: Developed new features, `errorBalanceOrig` and `errorBalanceDest`, to specifically capture balance mismatches indicative of fraud.
High Performance Achieved strong performance metrics including a ROC-AUC of 0.97, 91% precision, and 88% recall.
Actionable Insights: Provided recommendations for real-time model integration to proactively prevent suspicious transfers.

 Dataset
The model was trained and evaluated on a comprehensive financial transactions dataset comprising over 6.3 million records. The dataset includes various transaction attributes, allowing for detailed analysis and pattern recognition.

 Technical Stack
Programming Language: Python
  Libraries:
  `pandas` & `numpy` for data manipulation and analysis.
      `scikit-learn` for machine learning utilities and evaluation.
      `LightGBM` for the classification model.
       `matplotlib` & `seaborn` for data visualization.
Tools: Jupyter Notebooks for development and experimentation.

Model Performance
The model's effectiveness is demonstrated by the following key metrics:
ROC-AUC: 0.97
Precision: 91%
Recall: 88%

These metrics indicate the model's strong ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions while minimizing false positives and negatives.
